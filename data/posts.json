This happened to be next to a school and when I took off every single kid on the play ground was at the fence waving and and jumping around. I had my door off so I waved back with my helmeted and visored head. I had one of the biggest smiles that day and will always remember it. When I was around 10 a helicopter flew over my school, with the doors off. The pilots flew over and waved down at me. I dreamt of being a pilot after that day. 19 years later I was the guy waving down at the kids at the school. Not many fixed wing guys can have that same story.

You may have to alternately cover and uncover the pan and keep adding butter. Then, place the chicken skewers on a heated iron plate for sizzling effect and splash a few drops of water and oil on it. Serve immediately with mint chutney. You can also serve it on a bed of rice or noodles and it would become a complete meal.",

While it’s clear to me how this irrational belief came about, the concept of it being okay to disappoint others often comes as a surprise to clients. If you’re an adult walking around the planet trying not to disappoint people, finding out that you no longer need to think this way may shock you too. Where else did you learn that disappointment is a no no but in childhood. Here’s an example. Say, you’re an amazing artist and an outstanding soccer player but not so great in math which disappoints your dad who hoped you’d grow up to become an accountant like him. He lets you know frequently that he’s sad/upset/disappointed and, as a child, this makes you feel terrible because you love Dad ",

Bavaria's main cities are Munich (its capital and largest city and also the third largest city in Germany), Nuremberg, and Augsburg.The history of Bavaria includes its earliest settlement by Iron Age Celtic tribes, followed by the conquests of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC, when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of Raetia and Noricum. It became the Duchy of Bavaria (a stem duchy) in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. It was later incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire, became an independent kingdom after 1806, joined the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom, and finally became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949.",

    "description": "Thread the chicken onto the skewers, alternating it with chunks of onion, tomato and capsicum. Brush with butter, then grill until chicken is cooked through and is golden brown. You can also pan grill the chicken. In this case, just ensure that you keep the flame low and keep turning the chicken pieces. You may have to alternately cover and uncover the pan and keep adding butter. Then, place the chicken skewers on a heated iron plate for sizzling effect and splash a few drops of water and oil on it. Serve immediately with mint chutney. You can also serve it on a bed of rice or noodles and it would become a complete meal.",

    "description": "Many people have the odd belief that they should never disappoint others. The belief runs rampant in the eating disorders community. While it’s clear to me how this irrational belief came about, the concept of it being okay to disappoint others often comes as a surprise to clients. If you’re an adult walking around the planet trying not to disappoint people, finding out that you no longer need to think this way may shock you too. Where else did you learn that disappointment is a no no but in childhood. Here’s an example. Say, you’re an amazing artist and an outstanding soccer player but not so great in math which disappoints your dad who hoped you’d grow up to become an accountant like him. He lets you know frequently that he’s sad/upset/disappointed and, as a child, this makes you feel terrible because you love Dad ",

    "description": "Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as 'the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another' and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals. In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.",
